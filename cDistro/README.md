# cDistro Docker panel integration

The modifications for the Docker panel were integrated in Cloudy in https://github.com/Clommunity/cDistro

For this integration modifications were made to files in the following folders:

 /web/plug/avahi/
---
 /web/plug/controllers/
---
 /web/plug/menus/

When installing Cloudy packages through `cloudynitzar.sh,` the following folders are created to manage Docker containers:
/var/local/cDistro/plug/resources/docker
---
/var/local/cDistro/plug/resources/docker/containers
